Project is using a pnuematic operated glove to recover from stroke.
Glove is not my part.
A air pump is used to pump.
Speed control of pump is done. 5 Solenoids are used to control the flow for each finger.
A rotary encoder is used to set the finger, 5 LED are used to show, which sensor is selected. The  seperate push button is used pump/release the air selected finger.
The action of pump/release is got using a toggle switch.
2 push button is used to pump and release air in all fingers simultaneously.
As of this date, this project has the most ultilisation factor of arduino pins leaving only Tx, Rx as free(in real time).
